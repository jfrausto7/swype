Android Game made with Unity. Was previously published on Google Play Store, however it has since been removed due to new Community Policies that I cannot update because I have since lost the Unity library that goes with it. This is merely the last APK update that I made. It was created with the Unity game engine and written in C#.

UPDATE: As of 10/29/19, the app is back on the Google Play Store!
